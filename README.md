# CarbonFootPrint_LaunchCode_Project
Carbon Foot Print is the amount of carbon-dioxide emitted through various human activities. As we all are aware of the climate change and global warming and carbon-di-oxide is the major contributor for it, we all are supposed to know our carbon foot prints and take necessary actions to reduce it.
My Project collects data from user based on whether the user is a family man or a business person by creating user account and gives the total carbon-dioxide emitted based on the activities like car mileage values,home electricity bill,gas bill,travel in flights.Based on the total carbon-dioxide emitted it gives necessary steps to be taken to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions.
